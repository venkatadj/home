# Co-Learning Lounge

Welcome to Co-Learning Lounge, a non-profitable community where it adds wings to your flying career in the world of Artificial Intelligence. We are a group of Artificial Intelligence experts, Researchers, Data Scientist with rich experience in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, specialized in Natural Language Processing, Imaging, Recommendation systems,Time Series and lots more.

# Our Motive towards society

Our goal is to provide solid learning experience in Artificial Intelligence to everyone who
wish to groom their career as a Machine Learning Engineer, Deep Learning Engineer, Data
Analyst, Data Scientist, Statisticians etc.

# Our Vision

We desire to empower in newbies to become budding scientist of tomorrow in Artificial
intelligence.

# How Co-learning lounge can help to upskill

With years of experience we prepared our own contents so that it could be beneficial to
someone. We use to conduct AI – Boot Camps, Workshops, Group Discussions, Hackathons
etc.

## AI vs ML vs Deep Learning

![](images/aivsml.jpeg)

## What is Deep Learning?

Just like we use our brains to identify patterns and classify various types of information, deep learning algorithms can     be taught to accomplish the same tasks for machines.

   Example:
   Automatic car driving system is a good example of deep learning.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of AI and these are the algorithms which can learn by themselves without being externally programmed.

Example:
Amazon using machine learning to give better product choice recommendations to there costumers based on their preferences.
Netflix uses machine learning to give better suggestions to their users of the Tv series or movie or shows that they would like to watch.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence is a ability of computer program to function like a human brain

Example: Robots like Sophia
